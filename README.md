# homebridge-pioneer-avr-2025

Ready for Node 22 or lower.
This project was forked from [homebridge-pioneer-avr](https://github.com/kazcangi/homebridge-pioneer-avr).

homebridge-pioneer-avr is a plugin made for [homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge),
which declare your Pioneer AVR as a TV in homekit.

The updates to the Homebridge Plugin include enhanced performance and responsiveness, a maintained single Telnet session for faster command execution, compatibility with the latest Homebridge and Node.js versions, and general improvements for better reliability, ensuring that the plugin should work directly after configuration without any manual code adjustments.

### v0.0.9

* Fixed an issue related to volume control on Apple Watch. Users can now enjoy improved audio performance and seamless volume adjustments.

* Volume as Lightbulb works even finer now! ðŸ˜‰ Don't forget to configure it with 'maxVolumeSet': 70 or turn it off with 'maxVolumeSet': 0.

### v0.0.7

* Volume as Lightbulb works fine now

### v0.0.6

* The volume can now be adjusted within the Home icon of the receiver. However, this feature is still a bit buggy, and Iâ€™m working on it. All other functions are working fine. Turn it off with "maxVolumeSet": 0

The unused Remote-Key "Play/Pause" can now be used for toggle Listening-Mode between EXTENDED STEREO and PRO LOGIC 2 MOVIE.
Enhanced behavior when the Pioneer Receiver is not accessible over the network at plugin startup. The plugin will now attempt to establish a connection in such cases. This issue may occur due to network interruptions or power outages. While the functionality is not yet perfect, it has been significantly improved.
