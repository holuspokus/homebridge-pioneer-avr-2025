# homebridge-pioneer-avr-2025

A [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) plugin that integrates your Pioneer AVR as a TV accessory in HomeKit. This project is compatible with Node 22 and below, as well as Homebridge 2 or earlier versions. It is written in TypeScript and leverages the latest Homebridge methods and practices, ensuring a streamlined setup with optional manual configuration. The plugin automatically detects your receiver, even in environments with dynamic IP addresses, for a more reliable user experience.

> **Note**: This plugin is specifically designed for Pioneer models using the PRONTO protocol (e.g., VSX-922) and may not be compatible with newer models that use the ISCP protocol (e.g., VSX-LX304). For newer models, please consider using the [homebridge-onkyo-pioneer](https://github.com/nitaybz/homebridge-onkyo-pioneer) plugin or see the "Alternatives" section below.

## Features
With this plugin, you gain the ability to control multiple aspects of your Pioneer AVR, including:

* Power On/Off control
* Input selection directly within the Home app
* Volume adjustment (available as a Lightbulb control in the Home app)
* Customize visibility of inputs in the Home app
* Rename inputs for personalized identification
* Remote control functionality on iOS devices
* Use the iOS Remote's "Play/Pause" button to toggle between EXTENDED STEREO and PRO LOGIC 2 MOVIE modes
* Automatic input discovery

> The plugin is designed to function seamlessly out of the boxâ€”just install and start using it!


> **Migration Note**: If upgrading from the homebridge-pioneer-avr plugin to homebridge-pioneer-avr-2025, it is recommended to remove the old plugin and delete any existing accessories within the Homebridge settings or reset Homebridge entirely. Additionally, rebooting iOS devices is advisable for a smooth transition.
> Cleaning up the Homebridge configuration file ([config.json](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge/wiki/Homebridge-Config-JSON-Explained)) is recommended but not required.

## Installation
1. **Install Homebridge**: Follow the [Homebridge Installation Guide](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge/wiki).
